## Greetings!

- My name is Timothy, with the help of many friends and collegues, I've relocated to Portugal to persue a better quality of life for me and my family

- I have interests/skills in:
  
  - Ruby / Ruby on Rails
    
    - I am falling in love with Stimulus/Stimulus Reflex on the Rails platform! (Why not both?)
  
  - Tinkering with Frontend Frameworks, but no where near 'expert level'.
    
    - VueJS
    
    - Bootstrap (of course!)
    
    - Tailwind CSS (maybe one day)
  
  - Oracle (Yikes, she's a big beastie!)
    
    - Basic functionality
      
      - Cloning PDBs from one machine to another, and locally (I am impressed!)
      
      - expdp/impdp databases into target databases, usually in the 20G - 300GB range.
      
      - Basic psql queries (I can get around with joins and pulling the information I am looking for)
  
  - Homelabs (gotta flex those muscles)
    
    - Proxmox 
    
    - A used Ubiquti 24 POE switch (beauty!)
    
    - A used Ubiquiti EdgeRouter 4 (Love it!)
    
    - A used Ubiquiti Unifi wifi router (that signal is banging!)
    
    - Just starting to get cloudy with Digital Ocean. Neat stuff. I like the credit system.
  
  - Linux: Redhat and Redhat spins. Fedora is my favorite at home, and for an easy-spin server.
  
  - Anything I can tear apart, reverse engineer, tinker, and throw into a blender. A bad habit that formed when I was young.

  Currently, along with my other duties at my job, I use the above skills to create tools and small programs to make my team's life easier, save oodles of time by being lazy (I joke that I want to be the laziest person there by automating a lot of our paperwork tasks), and letting the computer do our mundane tasks for us. 

  I've created a [not so pretty at times, but it gets the job done. Sometimes the DRYing is crying] Rails app that will collect case data on open tickets, and create form letters and status tracking.
